# `angular-seed` â€” the seed for AngularTS apps

This project is an application skeleton for a typical [AngularTS][angularts] web app. You can use it to quickly bootstrap your next project.

It contains a sample AngularTS application and is preconfigured with all the necessary tools for developing, testing and deployment.

### Install Dependencies

```
make setup
```

### Run the Application

This project preconfigured the project with [Web Dev Server](https://modern-web.dev/docs/dev-server/overview/), an optimal solution for lightweight and buildless workflows. The simplest way to start the server is:

```
make start
```

Now open your browser to `localhost:4000/`

### Build the App for Production

AngularTS apps consist of static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that need to be hosted on a server accessible to browsers.
To generate a production-ready bundle with minified HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, run:

```
make build
```

Your app should be available in `/dist` folder and can then be uploaded to static server.
